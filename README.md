# Rubik

An experiment in geometry

Inspired by the beatufiul visualization shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z1fIsUNhO4), where a sphere projected onto an infinite plane produces mesmerizing effects.

The same can be achieved with a Rubik's cube, and the results are quite stunning.

This project is a fully functional implementation of a Rubik's cube, supporting all the complex motions such as twisting and turning.

In order for the [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection) to work, we can't quite use a cube. Instead we reshape the cube into a sphere, which looks like this:
