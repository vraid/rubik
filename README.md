Inspired by the beatufiul visualization shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z1fIsUNhO4), by reshaping the cube into a sphere we can project it onto a plane.

This project is a fully functional implementation of a Rubik's cube, supporting all the complex motions such as twisting and turning.
